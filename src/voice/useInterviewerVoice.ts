/**
 * The interviewer reads each line aloud, in the browser (2026-10-05) — the
 * interim output half of FR-6.10, as `speech.ts` is the input half.
 *
 * M11 owns voice. Until it exists, the browser's own speech synthesis speaks
 * each line of record in the voice the persona file names (`voice-core.ts`
 * chooses it), one sentence at a time. What M11 will do better, and this does
 * not try to: streaming the first clause before the line is finished, cutting
 * off within 350 ms when the student starts talking, and lip-sync from the
 * audio itself. This stops the moment the mic opens, which is the part of
 * barge-in a browser can do.
 *
 * New lines QUEUE behind the one being said — an acknowledgement and the next
 * question often arrive a moment apart, and the second must not cut the first
 * off mid-word. Only a repeat, a replay or a stop interrupts.
 *
 * The student can turn it off, and the choice is kept for this browser. A
 * screen-reader user hears the room's live region as well, so the off switch
 * is one press away rather than in a settings page.
 *
 * M11's, in core because more than one module speaks — see `core.ts`. The
 * `m06.voice` preference key is kept from when this lived in M06, so nobody's
 * off switch is lost in the move.
